Advent Of Code
---
Is awesome. It's a super cool idea! I didn't find it until 2017, but that doesn't mean I'm not going
to try and do it all this year. That means I have to solve (4) puzzles a day until the day before
Christmas. 

I'm currently fascinated with golang... so that's what I'll use. If you happen to stumble upon
this crap in the future and take umbridge with something I'm doing, please do leave a comment and let
me know.
